# Firefox Title Bar is missing

I recently updated my Firefox and when I started fresly updated Firefox
it looked like Chrome, I hate it, The Title Bar were missing.

If you click: `Open menu` > `Customize` and check 

|x| Title bar

Found this link where doin opposite of this: https://itsfoss.com/remove-title-bar-firefox/

## Title Bar also in Chrome

Same way you can set Title Bar in Chrome
`Settings` > `Use system title bar and borders`
