## Installing nginx with uWSGI with Python3-support on Debian

This doc is based on
(https://www.linode.com/docs/web-servers/nginx/use-uwsgi-to-deploy-python-apps-with-nginx-on-ubuntu-12-04/)

I allready Installed nginx
so I only install uWSGI.

```
sudo apt-get install uwsgi uwsgi-plugin-python3
```
